# test_your_typing
A Typing Speed Test built using Python and Pygame. This project allows users to measure their typing speed and accuracy by typing randomly AI generated paragraphs within a countdown timer. It provides real-time feedback, calculates Words Per Minute (WPM).

# 🖋️ Typing Speed Test with Pygame + AI Paragraph Generator

This is a Python-based **Typing Speed Test** application built using **Pygame** and **Hugging Face Transformers**. It generates random paragraphs using a language model (`distilgpt2`) and lets users test their typing speed (WPM) and accuracy in real-time.
